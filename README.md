# NFL Results Dashboard V1.7 - Supabase Connection Fix

1. Create a free Supabase project.
2. Open SQL Editor and run `supabase_schema.sql`.
3. In Supabase Project Settings, copy the Project URL and service_role key.
4. In Render > your web service > Environment, add:
   SUPABASE_URL
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
   ADMIN_PASSWORD
   NFL_SEASON=2026
5. Remove NFL_DB if it exists.
6. Replace the files in your GitHub repository with this V1.6 version and commit.
7. Render will redeploy automatically.

Build command:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start command:
    gunicorn app:app

Health check:
    /health

IMPORTANT: Keep the Supabase service_role key private. It belongs only in Render's environment variables.


## V1.7 connection fix

- Supports the newer `sb_secret_...` Supabase secret key and the legacy `service_role` key.
- Automatically removes `/rest/v1` if it was included in `SUPABASE_URL`.
- Writes the exact Supabase health-check error to Render logs if the connection still fails.


## V1.7 Draft Team Pool improvements

- Public leaderboard is read-only by default.
- Commissioner Edit mode verifies the admin password before enabling edits.
- NFL team selections use full-name dropdowns instead of typed abbreviations.
- Duplicate team selections for the same player are blocked.
- Positive scores are highlighted green; negative scores are highlighted red.
- Click a player name to view Week 1-18 scoring breakdown.
- Summary cards show player count, current leader, leading differential, and scoring weeks.
- Improved responsive/mobile layout.
- Existing Render + Supabase environment variables are unchanged.
